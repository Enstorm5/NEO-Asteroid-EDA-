Asteroid Close Approach Analysis Project

Developed data preprocessing pipeline for NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) close approach datasets
Created comprehensive visualizations to analyze asteroid behavior patterns, including:

Distance vs. size correlations
Velocity-distance relationships
Size distribution analysis
Time series analysis

Applied statistical analysis to understand key factors influencing asteroid close approaches.
